\chapter{Preamble}
\label{chap:intro}

Consider this your roadmap for the course.  Please read through the syllabus posted on moodle carefully and feel free to share any questions that you may have.  Please print a copy of the syllabus for reference. Some relevant parts of the syllabus are repeated here but the moodle reference should serve as your guide throughout the ten weeks of this course.

\section{Course Description}
This course focuses on the algorithmic and mathematical concepts  with respect to robot planning, manipulation and control. Topics covered include kinematics and dynamics, as well as path planning and deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Simulations and experiments on hardware testbeds (listed in the syllabus) will be performed to test the related algorithms.

\section{Course Outcomes}
After taking this course, each student will be able to

\begin{itemize}
\item Develop planning and manipulation schemes to drive robot operation

\item Integrate perception algorithms into manipulation and planning systems

\item Determine the kinematic description of a robot's motion or locomotion
\end{itemize}

\section{Prerequisites}

RBOT 210 or an advanced knowledge of ROS; undergraduate-level experience or equivalent with object oriented programming; strong programming knowledge in Python and C++ is required; and RBOT 205 if mathematical foundational skills of admissions criteria are needed.
