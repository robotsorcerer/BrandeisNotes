abstract = {This article presents the development of an autonomous motion planning algorithm for a soft planar grasping manipulator capable of grasp-and-place operations by encapsulation with uncertainty in the position and shape of the object. The end effector of the soft manipulator is fabricated in one piece without weakening seams using lost-wax casting instead of the commonly used multilayer lamination process. The soft manipulation system can grasp randomly positioned objects within its reachable envelope and move them to a desired location without human intervention. The autonomous planning system leverages the compliance and continuum bending of the soft grasping manipulator to achieve repeatable grasps in the presence of uncertainty. A suite of experiments is presented that demonstrates the system's capabilities.},

  abstract = {This manuscript describes a unique class of locomotive robot: A soft robot, composed exclusively of soft materials (elastomeric polymers), which is inspired by animals (e.g., squid, starfish, worms) that do not have hard internal skeletons. Soft lithography was used to fabricate a pneumatically actuated robot capable of sophisticated locomotion (e.g., fluid movement of limbs and multiple gaits). This robot is quadrupedal; it uses no sensors, only five actuators, and a simple pneumatic valving system that operates at low pressures (\&lt;~10~psi). A combination of crawling and undulation gaits allowed this robot to navigate a difficult obstacle. This demonstration illustrates an advantage of soft robotics: They are systems in which simple types of actuation produce complex motion.},

Pikul et al. used fixed-length fiber mesh embedded in a silicone elastomer to transform a flat object into a 3D structure by inflating membranes (see the Perspective by Laschi). Painted models of rocks and plants were also created that could be morphed to fully blend into their surroundings.Science, this issue p. 210; see also p. 169Technologies that use stretchable materials are increasingly important, yet we are unable to control how they stretch with much more sophistication than inflating balloons. Nature, however, demonstrates remarkable control of stretchable surfaces; for example, cephalopods can project hierarchical structures from their skin in milliseconds for a wide range of textural camouflage. Inspired by cephalopod muscular morphology, we developed synthetic tissue groupings that allowed programmable transformation of two-dimensional (2D) stretchable surfaces into target 3D shapes. The synthetic tissue groupings consisted of elastomeric membranes embedded with inextensible textile mesh that inflated to within 10\% of their target shapes by using a simple fabrication method and modeling approach. These stretchable surfaces transform from flat sheets to 3D textures that imitate natural stone and plant shapes and camouflage into their background environments.},

abstract = {Direct policy search can e ectively scale to high-dimensional systems, but complex policies with hundreds of parameters often present a challenge for such methods, requir- ing numerous samples and often falling into poor local optima. We present a guided pol- icy search algorithm that uses trajectory op- timization to direct policy learning and avoid poor local optima. We show how di erential dynamic programming can be used to gener- ate suitable guiding samples, and describe a regularized importance sampled policy opti- mization that incorporates these samples into the policy search. We evaluate the method by learning neural network controllers for planar swimming, hopping, and walking, as well as simulated 3D humanoid running.},

abstract = {We present a policy search method that uses iteratively refitted local linear models to optimize trajectory distributions for large, continuous problems. These tra-jectory distributions can be used within the framework of guided policy search to learn policies with an arbitrary parameterization. Our method fits time-varying linear dynamics models to speed up learning, but does not rely on learning a global model, which can be difficult when the dynamics are complex and discontinuous. We show that this hybrid approach requires many fewer samples than model-free methods, and can handle complex, nonsmooth dynamics that can pose a challenge for model-based techniques. We present experiments showing that our method can be used to learn complex neural network policies that successfully execute simulated robotic manipulation tasks in partially observed environments with nu-merous contact discontinuities and underactuation.},

@article{BADMM,
abstract = {The mirror descent algorithm (MDA) generalizes gradient descent by using a Bregman divergence to replace squared Euclidean distance. In this paper, we similarly generalize the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to Bregman ADMM (BADMM), which allows the choice of different Bregman divergences to exploit the structure of problems. BADMM provides a unified framework for ADMM and its variants, including generalized ADMM, inexact ADMM and Bethe ADMM. We estab-lish the global convergence and the O(1/T) iteration complexity for BADMM. In some cases, BADMM can be faster than ADMM by a factor of O(n/ log(n)) where n is the dimension of the problem. Ex-perimental results are illustrated on the mass transportation problem, which can be solved in parallel by BADMM. BADMM is faster than ADMM and highly optimized commercial software Gurobi, particu-larly when implemented on GPU.},

Abstract. Monte-Carlo evaluation consists in estimating a position by averaging the outcome of several random continuations, and can serve as an evaluation function at the leaves of a min-max tree. This paper presents a new framework to combine tree search with Monte-Carlo eval-uation, that does not separate between a min-max phase and a Monte-Carlo phase. Instead of backing-up the min-max value close to the root, and the average value at some depth, a more general backup operator is defined that progressively changes from averaging to min-max as the number of simulations grows. This approach provides a fine-grained con-trol of the tree growth, at the level of individual simulations, and allows efficient selectivity methods. This algorithm was implemented in a 9 × 9 Go-playing program, Crazy Stone, that won the 10th KGS computer-Go tournament.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate the acquisition of 3D functional object maps for indoor household environments, in particular kitchens, out of 3D point cloud data. By modeling the static objects in the world into hierarchical classes in the map, such as cupboards, tables, drawers, and kitchen appliances, we create a library of objects which a household robotic assistant can use while performing its tasks. Our method takes a complete 3D point cloud model as input, and computes an object model for it. The objects have states (such as open and closed), and the resultant model is accurate enough to use it in physics-based simulations, where the doors can be opened based on their hinge position. The model is built through a series of geometrical reasoning steps, namely: planar segmentation, cuboid decomposition, fixture recognition and interpretation (e.g. handles and knobs), and object classification based on object state information.},

abstract = {Many real-world applications can be described as large-scale games of imperfect information. To deal with these challenging domains, prior work has focused on computing Nash equilibria in a handcrafted abstraction of the domain. In this paper we introduce the first scalable end-to-end approach to learning approximate Nash equilibria without prior domain knowledge. Our method combines fictitious self-play with deep reinforcement learning. When applied to Leduc poker, Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP) approached a Nash equilibrium, whereas common reinforcement learning methods diverged. In Limit Texas Holdem, a poker game of real-world scale, NFSP learnt a strategy that approached the performance of state-of-the-art, superhuman algorithms based on significant domain expertise.},

The result - ing behaviors , illustrated in the attached video , are computed only 7 x slower than real time , on a standard PC . The video also shows results on the acrobot problem , planar swimming and one - legged hopping . These simpler problems can already be solved in real time , without pre - computing anything .},

abstract = {Many real-world applications can be described as large-scale games of imperfect information. To deal with these challenging domains, prior work has focused on computing Nash equilibria in a handcrafted abstraction of the domain. In this paper we introduce the first scalable end-to-end approach to learning approximate Nash equilibria without prior domain knowledge. Our method combines fictitious self-play with deep reinforcement learning. When applied to Leduc poker, Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP) approached a Nash equilibrium, whereas common reinforcement learning methods diverged. In Limit Texas Holdem, a poker game of real-world scale, NFSP learnt a strategy that approached the performance of state-of-the-art, superhuman algorithms based on significant domain expertise.},

Abstract— We present an online trajectory optimization method and software platform applicable to complex humanoid robots performing challenging tasks such as getting up from an arbitrary pose on the ground and recovering from large disturbances using dexterous acrobatic maneuvers . The result - ing behaviors , illustrated in the attached video , are computed only 7 x slower than real time , on a standard PC . The video also shows results on the acrobot problem , planar swimming and one - legged hopping . These simpler problems can already be solved in real time , without pre - computing anything .},
