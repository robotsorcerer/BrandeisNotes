Oi everybody!



How are you all coping with the new topics we are tasked with this week?



Do you have any thoughts or things that you've learned that you think is worth the while to share?



Well, I'll go first. The dynamics of an inverted spherical pendulum is a very important problem in the study of classical mechanics and control. Why? Because the equilibrium states are very sensitive to perturbations. To hammer home this point, I would invite you to imaging a round steel ball, suspended from a ceiling. Now imagine that the ceiling were upside down. And the ball was vertically aligned with respect to the horizontal (in this case the floor).  A small tilt in any direction would disturb the equilibrium states of the robot. So you need to
